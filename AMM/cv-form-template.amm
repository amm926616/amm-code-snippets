**Subject:** Internship Application – Aung Myint Myat

**Dear Hiring Team,**

I started learning programming after high school by teaching myself C++. It was tough at first, but it taught me to be patient and keep going. After taking a short break, I got back into programming through Python. I was drawn to how clean and flexible the language is. Since then, I’ve worked on small projects that solve real problems—from automating tasks to building full applications.

As a daily Arch Linux user, I’ve improved my workflow with Python and Bash scripts. I enjoy building tools that make life easier. Some of the projects I’ve worked on include:
    
- **[Hygiene Nerds](https://github.com/amm926616/hygiene-nerds)** – An online store built with React and Spring Boot
    
- **Other small tools** – Like automation scripts and a dictionary app (you can find them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/amm926616))

Most of my experience is in web development using JavaScript, React, Spring Boot, and Django. But I’m really interested in trying out machine learning through this internship. I’m new to it, but I’m confident that my strong Python skills and quick learning ability will help me pick it up fast.

What I’m looking forward to most in this internship is:

- Using my full-stack skills on real-world projects
    
- Learning new things with guidance from experienced developers
    
- Working with others who are passionate about building great software
    

I’ve attached my CV and would love the chance to talk more about how I can help your team. Thanks a lot for your time!

**Best regards,**  
Aung Myint Myat
