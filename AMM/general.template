Dear Unilink Team,

I’m writing to apply for the Junior Programmer position at your company. I was very excited to see that no prior work experience is required, as I’ve been looking for an opportunity where I can grow and apply the programming skills I’ve been building on my own.

I’m very passionate about programming, especially desktop application development. One of my favorite projects is April Music Player, a desktop app I built using Python and PyQt. I enjoy creating user-friendly tools that are useful in daily life, and desktop software has always been something I love working on.

I’ve also worked on full-stack web projects like Hygiene Nerds, and I’m always eager to learn new technologies. I may not have formal job experience yet, but I’ve spent a lot of time building real projects, improving my coding skills, and learning how to solve problems through programming.

I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science from the University of the People with a full scholarship. I also have strong English communication skills and am confident in my ability to work in a team and keep learning on the job.

I’ve attached my CV and would be very happy to talk more in an interview. Thank you for considering my application!

Best regards,
Aung Myint Myat
